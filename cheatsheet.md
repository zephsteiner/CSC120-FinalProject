# SPOILER ALERT

If your game includes challenges that must be overcome to win, also list them below.

To beat the game, you need to speak to at least 8 ghosts and procure their items, including the goat ghost in Mendenhall. You also need to collect at least one key, as only seven ghosts are not behind locked doors.
