Our overall approach was to design the classes and write basic methods for them first and then slowly bring everything together, writing the flavortext and the actual game loop last. To make this work, we made use of overloaded constructors so we could add things like ghost descriptions after building everything.

(Zephyr) The new things I learned on this project were how to visualize the way all of our code connected. Nothing we did was too different from what we've been doing all semester but completely buildign a game from scratch like this really helped my comprehension of how everything needed to work together. If we had unlimited time, I would have loved to have made our game map more complicated, with different outside areas. 

(Mackenzie) [put your new things, different implementation, unlimited time here]

The most helpful piece of feedback we got was from Jordan, who helped us figure out how to write the game loop in a way that was actually object oriented, since we were struggling to move past procedural thinking for that specific aspect.

Our advice to our past selves would be to write the basic game loop WAY earlier because it would have made testing everything much easier.

When we started the project, we split up the things we had to do between the two of us which was a helpful starting point for the pretty organic way that we divided things as they came up. We used our in-class time (and occasionally staying late) to work on things that needed both of us to think about and then took on separate tasks (usually in separate files, for github reasons) to take home.
